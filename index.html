        <div class="col">
            <p>MooreLabs was originally started when Russell Moore began consulting on hardware and software in 1994. Russ's son, Stephen, has taken up the
            MooreLabs name.</p>
            <p>Stephen Moore graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1998 with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
            While at CMU, Steve focused on robotics and control systems, as well as interactive electro-mechanical art. After graduating he worked at
            Motorola writing software for a Just In Time manufacturing process building two way paging infrastructure. Later moving on to doing advanced technology
            consulting with Aurthur Andersen, helping companies understand how they could use the internet with their business.</p>
            <p>Steve has often helped with some of his father's work on custom hardware oriented projects. For example, building and writing control software for custom
            biology lab experimentation equipment, working with researchers to make sure the device could perform the experiments they wanted.</p>
            <p>Steve spent over 12 years working at the MITRE corporation, once again helping clients use technology to solve problems. Examples
            include working with clients to understand how they could adapt Statistical Language Translation systems to fit in their workflow, building
            an intranet based system to utilize these tools developed for document translation into more real time chat and web site translation.</p>
            <p>Steve is currently a Co-Founder and V.P. of R&D for <a href="http://www.visexcell.com/">VisExcell</a>, a company that is
            helping radiologist bring Breast Cancer Risk assessment to their patients utilizing machine learning.</p>
